THIS IS THE PLAN


Justin:
What i'm working on right now,
	node.js server and database
	map interface for events.
	action bar (the bar at the top) junk.

Ryley:



Robbie:



Geun:




To import the project
Android Studio -> import -> potato/eventapp



What needs to be done to have a working prototype:
Listview (RecyclerView) for events - this will have the same stuff as on the maps
A way to add events
A way to set up profiles
Let Me(Justin) know what is part of the event and we can figure out how to send it to the server / how I can receive it since it has to match

Other implementable stuff:
A way to organize users into groups and manage events based on group (hella later)
User profiles and Event profiles, user profiles can report how "active" they are etc.
Event/host profiles should be more indepth so not sketch - geuns idea
Filter events in list by distance

ACTIONBAR/TOOLBAR on top:
tabs to switch between
	 map
	 list of events (organized by distance)

Button to create new event




Options that events will have? Add and remove ideas
--------------------
Location
What is at the event (video games, alchohol, etc?)
Host information - hosts will be asked to have a profile?
